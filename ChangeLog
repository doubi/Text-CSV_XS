2007-06-03  0.28 - H.Merijn Brand   <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

    * IMPORTANT CHANGE: new () returns undef if it gets unsupported
      attributes. Until now, new ({ esc_char => "\\" }) was just
      silently ignored. Rejecting it and failing is better than
      continuing with false assumptions.
    * Added allow_loose_quotes  (see doc)
    * Added t/65_allow.t
    * Added allow_loose_escapes (see doc) (RT#15076)

	This one still passes under perl 5.00504
      - Regression         for RT#18703: Fails to use quote_char of '~'
    * Added t/55_combi.t for most combinations of always_quote,
      sep_char, quote_char, and escape_char
    * Added docs about sep_char not allowed to be either quote_char
      or escape_char
    * Both combine () and parse () now return FALSE id sep_char is
      equal to either quote_char or escape_char. Done in XS, as it
      was a slowdown of 10% when done in perl.

    * Merijn got the maintainership

      More to do in this area
    - renamed test to fixate the sequence
    - Added t/50_utf8.t
    - tests now use Test::More

      except for the ->{types} and ->{_types}
    - Moved test.pl to examples/speed.pl

2001-10-10  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.23)

    * Changed "char" to "unsigned char" in CSV_XS.xs.
      Matthew Graham <MGraham@pacificaccess.com.au>

2000-12-22  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.22)

    * CSV_XS.xs: Added the handling of escape characters
      outside of quotes. Kirill Paliy <kpaliy@aaanet.ru>

2000-08-18  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.21)

    * CSV_XS.pm (parse): Minor bugfix in the parse method.
      Norikatsu Shigemura (nork@cityfujisawa.ne.jp)

1999-06-28  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.20)

    * CSV_XS.xs: Fixed a bug in the decoder where escapeChar wasn't
      handled right. Pavel Kotala <pkotala@logis.cz>

1999-05-01  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.19)

    * CSV_XS.xs: Setting escape_char => undef should now work.
      Requested by Syed Muhammad Nayeem <smnayeem@dhaka.agni.com>

1999-04-05  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.18)

      and the like.

1999-03-04  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.17)

    * CSV_XS.pm: Added always_quote attribute. 
      (Ken Williams <kwilliam@DigitalRiver.com>)
    * The types method is now implemented in Perl.

1999-02-11  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.16)

    * CSV_XS.pm: PV, IV and NV are no longer exportable, so that I
      need not inherit from Exporter any longer. (This caused trying
      to autoload DESTROY without any reason. Seems to me to be a
      serious performance penalty.)
    * CSV_XS.pm: Being a little bit less strict now: If quoteChar and
      escapeChar are different, then the quote char may be part of
      the field. (Not at the fields start, of course.)

1998-08-21  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.15)

    * CSV_XS.pm: Moved print () and getline () to XS.

    * Added $csv->{eol}

    * Added $csv->{quote_char} = undef

1998-05-05  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.10)

      print () and getline () methods.

1998-06-05  Alan Citterman  <alan@mfgrtl.com>
