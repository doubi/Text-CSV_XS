2007-05-15  0.26 - H.Merijn Brand   <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	* Add $csv->allow_undef (1) suggestion in TODO
	  Still have to find the best spot to document
	  the difference between empty string and undef
	* Spell-checked the pod and fixed some typo's
	* Added t/70_rt.t
	  - Regression         for RT 24386: \t doesn't work (WFM)
	  - Regression and fix for RT 21530: getline () return at eof
	    This one still passes under perl 5.00504
	  - Regression         for RT 18703: Fails to use quote_char of '~'
	* Added t/55_combi.t for most combinations of always_quote,
	  sep_char, quote_char, and escape_char
	* Added docs about sep_char not allowed to be either quote_char
	  or escape_char
	* Both combine () and parse () now return FALSE id sep_char is
	  equal to either quote_char or escape_char. Done in XS, as it
	  was a slowdown of 10% when done in perl.

	- added pod coverage and small additions to the pod.
	  More to do in this area
	- renamed test to fixate the sequence
	- Added t/50_utf8.t
	- tests now use Test::More
	  . Makefile.PL requires Test::More
	- checked proclaimed version compatibility
	  . 5.9.x-64int     works @31159
	  . 5.8.x-64int-dor works @31162
	  . 5.8.0-dor       works
	  . 5.6.2           works

	- Added tests for deleting types (coverage now over 99%)
	- Added is_quoted (), is_binary () and tests
	- Added COPYRIGHT section to pod
	- Added the parse example from the pod to test.pl
	- Added accessor methods for internals: quote_char () et all
	- Added tests for the new accessor methods
	- Added always_quote to the missing places in the doc and in new ()
	- Changed the tests to use the accessors instead of the hash keys
	  except for the ->{types} and ->{_types}

2001-10-10  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.23)

	* Changed "char" to "unsigned char" in CSV_XS.xs.
	  Matthew Graham <MGraham@pacificaccess.com.au>

2000-12-22  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.22)

	* CSV_XS.xs: Added the handling of escape characters
	  outside of quotes. Kirill Paliy <kpaliy@aaanet.ru>

2000-08-18  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.21)

	* CSV_XS.pm (parse): Minor bugfix in the parse method.
	  Norikatsu Shigemura (nork@cityfujisawa.ne.jp)

1999-06-28  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.20)

	* CSV_XS.xs: Fixed a bug in the decoder where escapeChar wasn't
	  handled right. Pavel Kotala <pkotala@logis.cz>

1999-05-01  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.19)

	* CSV_XS.xs: Setting escape_char => undef should now work.
	  Requested by Syed Muhammad Nayeem <smnayeem@dhaka.agni.com>

1999-04-05  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.18)

	* CSV_XS.pm: Portability fixes (sv_undef => PL_sv_undef
	  and the like.

1999-03-04  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.17)

	* CSV_XS.pm: Added always_quote attribute. 
	  (Ken Williams <kwilliam@DigitalRiver.com>)
	* The types method is now implemented in Perl.

1999-02-11  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.16)

	* CSV_XS.pm: PV, IV and NV are no longer exportable, so that I
	  need not inherit from Exporter any longer. (This caused trying
	  to autoload DESTROY without any reason. Seems to me to be a
	  serious performance penalty.)
	* CSV_XS.pm: Being a little bit less strict now: If quoteChar and
	  escapeChar are different, then the quote char may be part of
	  the field. (Not at the fields start, of course.)

1998-08-21  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.15)

	* CSV_XS.pm: Moved print() and getline() to XS.

1998-08-13  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.14)

	* CSV_XS.xs: Forgot to escape sepchar; patched by Paul Walmsley,
	  <shag@nicar.org>.

	* CSV_XS.xs (Encode): Strings qre quoted only if required. 
	* CSV_XS.xs: Added support for $csv->{types}.
