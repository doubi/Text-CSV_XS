2008-04-07  0.40 - H.Merijn Brand   <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	* Implemented getline_hr () and column_names () RT 34474
	  (suggestions accepted from Mark Stosberg)
	* Corrected misspelled variable names in XS

	* Removed prototypes
	* Added a SPECIFICATION section to the pod
	* Safe caching of eol, and a warning in the docs
	* Rewrote t/20_file.t do do actual file IO instead of IO_Scalar fake
	* Small optimization for parse (juerd)
	* Added make target test_speed
	* Merged the items from CAVEAT to SPECIFICATION
	* Updated the TODO and Release Plan sections
	* Speed up internals by using references instead of copies (juerd)
	* Reworked error_input, which also had an undetected internal error
	* Added IO tests for lexical IO handles and perlio IO to/from scalars

2007-06-03  0.28 - H.Merijn Brand   <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	* IMPORTANT CHANGE: new () returns undef if it gets unsupported
	  attributes. Until now, new ({ esc_char => "\\" }) was just
	  silently ignored. Rejecting it and failing is better than
	  continuing with false assumptions.
	* Added allow_loose_quotes  (see doc)
	* Added t/65_allow.t
	* Added allow_loose_escapes (see doc) RT 15076
	* More code cleanup in XS
	* Added allow_whitespace    (see doc)

2007-05-31  0.27 - H.Merijn Brand   <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	* checked with perlcritic (still works under 5.00504)
	  so 3-arg open cannot be used (except in the docs)
	* 3-arg open in docs too
	* Added a lot to the TODO list
	* Some more info on using escape character (jZed)
	* Mention Text::CSV_PP in README
	* Added t/45_eol.t, eol tests
	* Added a section about embedded newlines in the pod
	* Allow \r as eol ($/) for parsing
	* More docs for eol
	* More eol = \r fixes, tfrayner's test case added to t/45_eol.t

2007-05-15  0.26 - H.Merijn Brand   <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	* Add $csv->allow_undef (1) suggestion in TODO
	  Still have to find the best spot to document
	  the difference between empty string and undef
	* Spell-checked the pod and fixed some typo's
	* Added t/70_rt.t
	  - Regression         for RT 24386: \t doesn't work (WFM)
	  - Regression and fix for RT 21530: getline () return at eof
	    This one still passes under perl 5.00504
	  - Regression         for RT 18703: Fails to use quote_char of '~'
	* Added t/55_combi.t for most combinations of always_quote,
	  sep_char, quote_char, and escape_char
	* Added docs about sep_char not allowed to be either quote_char
	  or escape_char
	* Both combine () and parse () now return FALSE id sep_char is
	  equal to either quote_char or escape_char. Done in XS, as it
	  was a slowdown of 10% when done in perl.

2007-05-07  0.25 - H.Merijn Brand   <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	* Merijn got the maintainership
	- code reformat and code cleanup
	- renamed internal (Encode, Decode) to (Combine, Parse) to

	- added pod coverage and small additions to the pod.
	  More to do in this area
	- renamed test to fixate the sequence
	- Added t/50_utf8.t
	- tests now use Test::More
	  . Makefile.PL requires Test::More
	- checked proclaimed version compatibility
	  . 5.9.x-64int     works @31159
	  . 5.8.x-64int-dor works @31162
	  . 5.8.0-dor       works
	  . 5.6.2           works
	  . 5.005.04        works
	  . 5.004.05        fails
	- 5.005 is now prerequisite
	- Added missing info in docs for new ()

	  except for the ->{types} and ->{_types}
	- Moved test.pl to examples/speed.pl

2001-10-10  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.23)

	* Changed "char" to "unsigned char" in CSV_XS.xs.
	  Matthew Graham <MGraham@pacificaccess.com.au>

2000-12-22  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.22)

	* CSV_XS.xs: Added the handling of escape characters
	  outside of quotes. Kirill Paliy <kpaliy@aaanet.ru>

2000-08-18  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.21)

	* CSV_XS.pm (parse): Minor bugfix in the parse method.
	  Norikatsu Shigemura (nork@cityfujisawa.ne.jp)

1999-06-28  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.20)

	* CSV_XS.xs: Fixed a bug in the decoder where escapeChar wasn't
	  handled right. Pavel Kotala <pkotala@logis.cz>

1999-05-01  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.19)

	* CSV_XS.xs: Setting escape_char => undef should now work.
	  Requested by Syed Muhammad Nayeem <smnayeem@dhaka.agni.com>

1999-04-05  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.18)

	* CSV_XS.pm: Portability fixes (sv_undef => PL_sv_undef
	  and the like.

1999-03-04  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.17)

	* CSV_XS.pm: Added always_quote attribute. 
	  (Ken Williams <kwilliam@DigitalRiver.com>)
	* The types method is now implemented in Perl.

1999-02-11  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.16)

	* CSV_XS.pm: PV, IV and NV are no longer exportable, so that I
	  need not inherit from Exporter any longer. (This caused trying
	  to autoload DESTROY without any reason. Seems to me to be a
	  serious performance penalty.)
	* CSV_XS.pm: Being a little bit less strict now: If quoteChar and
	  escapeChar are different, then the quote char may be part of
	  the field. (Not at the fields start, of course.)

1998-08-21  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.15)

	* CSV_XS.pm: Moved print() and getline() to XS.

1998-08-13  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.14)

	* CSV_XS.xs: Forgot to escape sepchar; patched by Paul Walmsley,
	  <shag@nicar.org>.

1998-07-20  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.13)

	* CSV_XS.xs (Encode): Strings qre quoted only if required. 
	* CSV_XS.xs: Added support for $csv->{types}.

1998-06-11  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.12)

	* CSV_XS.xs (Encode): Integers and Reals are no longer quoted.

	* Added $csv->{types}.

1998-05-12  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.11)

	* Added $csv->{eol}

	* Added $csv->{quote_char} = undef

1998-05-05  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.10)

	* Moved encoding and decoding to XS; added binary mode; added
	  print() and getline() methods.

1998-06-05  Alan Citterman  <alan@mfgrtl.com>

	* Initial version
