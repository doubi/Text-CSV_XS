Dear MacPerl Users,

this is the Text::CSV_XS 0.23 module with a shared library compiled for MacPerl 5.6.1
(and higher). This was compiled with MPW's MrC (PPC). Passed all tests with the MPW MrC
build of the MacPerl 5.6.1 application. Let me know of any problems you might 
encounter.


CAVEATS
=======
Text::CSV_XS doesn't recognize Macintosh line endings (\015 - CR). A CSV string may only 
be terminated by a Unix line ending (\012 - LF) or a DOS line ending (\015\012 - CRLF).
See CAVEATS, point 5, in CSV_XS.pm.

Since Text::CSV_XS is supposed to be used with DBD::CSV, you should be careful here. A 
workaround would be a line ending conversion of your CSV files.


*** NOTE:
This package contains shared libraries, which are loaded dynamically by MacPerl -- 
well, normally. Currently, dynamic loading of shared libs might NOT work with the MPW 
MacPerl tool, when build with Apple's MrC compiler. However, dynamic loading always works 
reliable with the MacPerl application (the official MacPerl release has been built with 
the Codewarrior compilers, so don't worry too much). Note also that dynamic loading is 
NOT supported by the 68K versions of the MacPerl application and tool. And finally, note 
that this distribution will NOT work with good old MacPerl 5.2.0r4.


You can download the Text-CSV_XS-0.23-bin56Mac.tgz tarball from my CPAN directory

INSTALLATION
============
The module is best installed using Chris Nandor's installme.plx droplet. Simply 
drop the packed archive or the unpacked folder on the droplet. Answer the 
upcoming question "Convert all text and MacBinary files?" with "Yes". This should 
install the module properly. 

Since MacPerl 5.6.1 beta 1, the installer is part of the MacPerl disribution.
	

Have fun.
