This is the Text::CSV_XS module with shared libraries compiled for 
MacPerl.  Shared libraries run only on PPC and CFM68K versions, not 
non-CFM 68K versions.

This was compiled with MPW and Codewarrior.  Passed all tests.  
I have no 68K machine so I can't test the CFM68K version.  Let me 
know of any problems.

Also recommended are Paul Schinder's Fixed Library Routines,
available from his web site:

    http://www.pobox.com/~schinder/MacPerl.html

Best installed using cpan-mac, either with the CPAN shell,
or the installme droplet.  From the CPAN shell, type:

    cpan> install CNANDOR/Text-CSV_XS-0.15-bin-2-Mac.tgz
