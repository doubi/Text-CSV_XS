Module:
    Text::CSV_XS

Description:
    Text::CSV_XS provides facilities for the composition and decomposition of
    comma-separated values.  An instance of the Text::CSV_XS class can combine
    fields into a CSV string and parse a CSV string into fields.

    A pure-perl version is being maintained by Makamaka Hannyaharamitu
    as Text::CSV_PP, which tries to follow Text::CSV_XS very closely.

    Expect Text::CSV to be a wrapper module over Text::CSV_XS and
    Text::CSV_PP that will select Text::CSV_XS if available, and
    otherwise use Text::PP.
